![](logo.png)

## Overview
This project analyzes Netflix movies and TV shows data using SQL to solve real business problems and extract actionable insights that support content strategy and decision-making.

## Business Problem

- Streaming platforms like Netflix must continuously analyze their content library to make better decisions around content acquisition, production, and audience engagement.

#### The key business challenge is:

- How can we use content metadata (genre, release year, country, cast, ratings, and descriptions) to understand content trends, audience preferences, and platform growth opportunities?

#### This project addresses that challenge by analyzing:
- Content distribution (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Viewer targeting through ratings and genres
- Regional content performance (e.g., India vs other countries)
- Actor and director influence on content volume
- Content freshness and growth trends over time
- Risk-sensitive content using keyword-based classification
- Strategic insights for catalog optimization and recommendation decisions
- The goal is to simulate how a real-world data analyst supports data-driven decision-making for a streaming business.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Executive Summary

- Movies dominate Netflix’s catalog, making up the majority of available content.
- Most Netflix content has been released after 2015, indicating rapid platform expansion.
- The United States and India are the leading content-producing countries.
- TV-MA is the most common rating, indicating Netflix’s strong focus on mature audiences.
- Drama and International genres are the most prevalent on the platform.
- Most movies have a runtime between 90 and 120 minutes.

## Business Recommendations

### Based on the insights, the following actions are recommended:

- Invest more in high-performing content formats such as Movies.
- Strengthen content production and acquisition in the U.S. and India markets.
- Prioritize Drama and International genres in future content strategy.
- Continue targeting mature audiences through TV-MA rated content.
- Maintain optimal movie duration (90–120 minutes) aligned with viewer preference.
